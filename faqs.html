				<h2 id="q1">How long have you been an artist?</h2>
				<p>I've been drawing and sketching since I was a child. I was almost always just doodling for fun, but when I was in fourth grade, I sold my first piece, a colored pencil drawing, to the local hospital. The hospital chose my art, along with two others, from a large group of artists from my school to be framed and placed in its Children's wing. It was then that I realized I might have a talent for drawing, which inspired me to continue persuing it throughout my life.</p>

				<h2 id="q2">What made you want to pursue design?</h2>
				<p>I've worked in many fields throughout my career and it seemed that during all of them, I'd either be asked, or find myself volunteering to create posters, artwork, or some kind of artistic endeavor for the companies. It wasn't until recently that I decided to pursue graphic design as a way to continue my love of art, but in a way that I could make into a career.</p>

				<h2 id="q3">What are your favorite types of media and tools?</h2>
				<p>I like to try many types of media, however, I feel most comfortable using ink pens and colored pencils. The most common pens I use are PigmaMicron Fineliners. For colored pencils I typically use PrismaColor or Blick Stuio brands. I have recently gotten into Art Markers and have been playing with PrismaColor, PandaFly and Copic brands in than medium. I also paint, where I use mostly acrylic on canvas (while dabbling in watercolors). If you would like to see my work in these areas, you can view or follow me at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joshuadagesartwork/" target="_blank">@joshuadagesartwork</a>.</p>
				<p>Now that I am becomming familiar with digital programs like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, as well as Autodesk Maya, I have also been working on a Huion 640P digital drawing pad.</p>

				<h2 id="q4">Did you got to school for art or design?</h2>
				<p>I studied art for one semester in college and have always regretted not sticking with it. Looking back, I don't know why I changed majors as I really have fond memories of that time. I took a few courses as electives throughout the rest of my college career, but mostly practiced on my own. I am now enrolled in the Digital and Graphic Design Certificate Program at Parsons School of Design and will hopefully finish the program by the end of the year 2018.</p>

				<h2 id="q5">Can I purchase any of your work?</h2>
				<p>Currenly I'm selling prints of multiple pen and colored pencil works, which can be viewed and purchased at <a href="https://joshuadagesartwork.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank">joshuadagesartwork.bigcartel.com</a>.</p>
