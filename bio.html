			<p>In each of the fields and industries which I have worked, my skills and interests continually led me to seek out, and work on design projects. I am therefore pursuing a career in graphic design and currently completing the Graphic and Digital Design Certificate requirements at Parsons School of Design in New York City.</p>

			<p>Not only has designing, creating and editing many types of professional media allow me to advance my workplace and benefit the community, but working in the music industry and the legal field has given me the skills needed to flourish in a constantly changing work environment. I have also found that traveling to various countries has strengthened my love of our diverse world and deepened my enjoyment of volunteer work.</p>
