			<p>Hello! I'm Josh and I'm a graphic designer based in Brooklyn, New York. My design work includes logo and brand identity, digital design and print media. In my spare time, I also work in illustration and fine art.</p>

			<p>In each of the fields and industries which I have worked, my interests continually led me to seek out design projects. Therefore, in 2018, I decided to go back to school where I earned my Graphic and Digital Design Certificate at Parsons School of Design in New York City. During that time, I also co-founded the design group Bolida, a studio that specializes in brand design for small businesses and individuals.</p>

			<p>Designing, creating and editing many types of professional media allows me to advance ideas in any office setting, flourish in constantly changing work environments, and benefit the community with informed and artistic material. My time spent working in the music industry and the legal field enables me to bring years of diverse experience to my work. Additionally, my time traveling around the world has strengthened my love of the planet and deepened my enjoyment of volunteer work, which fosters my knack for working on any team.</p>

			<p>If you like my work, or just want to discuss art and design over coffee, you can reach me at
